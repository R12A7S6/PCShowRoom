Build no.3, an Entertainment Center built for my brother that runs as well as it looks (12/2022):

Assembly Snapshots:

Disassembling the old PC (RIP, mid 2000s - 2022). It had a mid-life upgrade on its internals so some components can be picked out and reused (ie. Power Supply, GPU, HDDs and 2.5"/M.2 SSDs). Standing issues include obvious heat problems and failing RAM and motherboard temperature sensors.

Assembly began with the motherboard, and on it goes for the smallest, least obstructive components - CPU, RAM and M.2 SSD.

Seating the motherboard into the case. The three front fans were pre-installed and came hooked up to its own fan controller. The next picture will show this controller, and it will be connected to the motherboard via a USB3.0 port.

This is the other side of the case with the case cover removed. The controller mentioned before is visible at the centre of this picture.

In this shot, most of the connectors have been plugged in. The front panel connectors were once again challenging, but at least they were all bundled up in pairs, unlike those in my first build...

It was such an enjoyment to put everything together that I had forgotten to take pictures of each step. Also, because Ryzen 7 5800X does not come with a thermal solution (aka its own fan), I lent a Wraith Stealth CPU cooler from my Ryzen 5 5600X to this build. Its suitability will be discussed below.

First boot rarely works. Although the red light from the POST (Power-On Self Test) here (on the right of the RAMs) went away immediately after I snapped this, boot failed to load the Windows 10 on the M.2 SSD. Turns out that either the EFI partition or the bootloader was on the 3.5' HDD, of which if you squint, you can find that no SATA connectors are plugged in just yet (far right of the GPU, next to where the 24-pin bundle sneaks to the back).

You can squint again, and you will not see a plugged in SATA connector due to bad angle (my bad! Squint at the next picture though). But in this picture, the air cooler had been swapped out for a liquid cooler that my brother had picked, which has the pretty lights. Personally, I have an aversion to Corsair's liquid coolers because their radiator's screw holes are fairly flimsy and unsuitable for multiple re-installations (such as for cleaning or swapping). Regardless, with the air cooler, CPU Temperature used to reach 80+ degrees Celsius under load until I applied an under-clock. But with the liquid cooler, it's never broken through 70Â°C even at stock frequency.

And it is done! The most smooth-sailing build I've ever experienced from building to booting up. There was an additional hiccup with the liquid cooler's screw holes not aligning with those on the case due to the RAM's height. I was too reliant on pcpartpicker and missed the helpful compatibility table on Corsair's product page. Regardless, it was a small misalignment, and we ended up expanding the screw holes horizontally for a fit. The dust filter that came with the case was all too helpful at hiding the blunder.
Although I won't get to use this PC, it has been a fun journey and I have since enjoyed being mesmerised by the sight of it.

In actuality, the upgrades were done more sporadically. They are grouped into 4 here only for simplicity's sake.
