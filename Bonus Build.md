Build no. 0 (Bonus), actually built by my Dad as a Family PC but then became a hand-me-down for me. (Early 2000 - 2012?):

Specs:
- EPox EP-4PLAI (Motherboard)
- Intel Pentium 4 (Northwood or Prescott)
- Intel Stock Cooler
- Unknown brand and model of RAM. Possibly 2GB
- Uncertain brand and unknown model of GPU. Possibly Sapphire's flavour of the Radeon line, with 256 or 512MB VRAM.
- Unknown HDD x2. One on top is 80GB.
- Unknown CD/DVD Drive x2
- Unknown Power Supply Unit
- Uncertain Case. Possible Mecca CP-101 Future Dreamers Mid Tower, based on mentions from an online forum and a store's webpage. (See Reference 1 and 2 below.)

Uncertain specs were guessed using visible details such as markings and stickers, then cross-checked with Google searches.

It was on this PC that I learnt how to:
- use a Windows computer
- play video games (Counter Strike 1.6, Battlefield 1942 - 2142, Halo, GTA SA etc.)
- edit pixels of a screenshot with Paint
- touch type
- end processes with Task Manager to free up RAM without crashing Windows XP
- open the side panel of a desktop PC

As mentioned, this one was built by my father. This is the second PC that I can call mine. "My" first PC now exists only in fading memories, it had a horizontal PC case instead of an upright one such as this. You might wonder why this PC has 2 CD/DVD Drive. Fragments of my memory indicate a salvage outcome from possibly that first PC or another PC from the same period. Anyway, the following is a side shot with the panel removed.

My contribution to this build was the build up of dust, wear, and the half-removed sticker on the CPU fan. Regarding the sticker, I remember that it was an attempt to lubricate the fan. I also tried to power up this build on 16/11/2023 for the first time in many years. The goal was to use its IDE interface to securely wipe an IDE HDD that belonged to my boss at Kellyville Chemist, with his permission. Regardless, powering up failed. The cause was either two broken power supplies, a failed power button, a failed motherboard, or any combination of the four.
Fun fact, the motherboard's power connector is NOT on the right side next to the RAM, but below the bottom left corner of the CPU fan. I am speaking from first-hand experience...

In the picture below, you can find 2 rusted VGA connectors, an unused 40mm case fan cutout and an 80mm case fan cutout occupied but secured with just 2 screws. Perhaps the builder saved them for another build.

In-between Build 0 and "my" first PC, there was also an Apple's iMac (now known as the iMac G3). My experience with it can be summed up with one word - **Nanosaur**.
